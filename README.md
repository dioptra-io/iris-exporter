# iris-exporter

## Design

Exporting Iris data to various formats is a data-intensive task that requires to fetch and transform 100GB+ of data per measurement.
The majority of the work is done by the [pantrace](https://github.com/dioptra-io/pantrace).
This repository contains scripts for orchestrating data extraction, transformation and load into S3.
